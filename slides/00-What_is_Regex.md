## What are Regular Expressions?

- Regular expressions, usually abbreviated to "regex", are a way to programmatically match text.

- While not everything is able to be parsed perfectly with regex, like [HTML](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454), it can be a great starting point for a more advanced script.

- Different tools support different "flavors" of regex, so it's important to know what's supported in your chosen tool.

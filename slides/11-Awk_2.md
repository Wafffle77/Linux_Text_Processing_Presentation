## More Awk

Basic Awk scripts are composed of rules. These rules have two parts: the match expression and the action.

- The expression decides if the rule is executed.
    - It can be a single regex to match the line.
    - It can also be an expression that matches the fields or other variables.
    - It can also be completely omitted to make the block run unconditionally.

```awk
/^GET/ {print $2} # Print the path of an HTTP request
$1 == "GET" {print($2);} # The exact same thing
```

- The block contains actions to perform on a successful match.
    - These blocks can span multiple lines, and functions can be separated with semicolons.
    - Function calls can be performed with or without parentheses.

- Variables are closer to C or Python than Bash, and are accessed simply by writing their name
    - Some special variables are defined, such as `$1`, `$2`, etc. for field contents, as well as `$0` for the entire line.
